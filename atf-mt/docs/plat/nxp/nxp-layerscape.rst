DDR Memory Layout
--------------------------

NXP Platforms divide DRAM into banks:

- DRAM0 Bank:  Maximum size of this bank is fixed to 2GB, DRAM0 size is defined in platform_def.h if it is less than 2GB.

- DRAM1 ~ DRAMn Bank:  Greater than 2GB belongs to DRAM1 and following banks, and size of DRAMn Bank varies for one platform to others.

The following diagram is default DRAM0 memory layout in which secure memory is at top of DRAM0.

Build Procedure
---------------

-  Fetch all the above repositories into local host.

-  Prepare AARCH64 toolchain and set the environment variable "CROSS_COMPILE".

   .. code:: shell

       export CROSS_COMPILE=.../bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-

-  Build RCW. Refer README from the respective cloned folder for more details.

-  Build u-boot and OPTee firstly, and get binary images: u-boot.bin and tee.bin.
   For u-boot you can use the <platform>_tfa_defconfig for build.

-  Copy/clone the repo "ddr-phy-binary" to the tfa directory for platform needing ddr-fip.

-  Below are the steps to build TF-A images for the supported platforms.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-To compile additional fip-ddr for selected platforms(Refer above table if the platform needs fip-ddr).
   .. code:: shell

	make PLAT=<platform_name> fip-ddr


Deploy ATF Images
=================

Note: The size in the standard uboot commands for copy to nor, qspi, nand or sd
should be modified based on the binary size of the image to be copied.

-  Deploy ATF images on flexspi-Nor or QSPI flash Alt Bank from U-Boot prompt.

   --  Commands to flash images for bl2_xxx.pbl and fip.bin

   Notes: ls1028ardb has no flexspi-Nor Alt Bank, so use "sf probe 0:0" for current bank.

   .. code:: shell

        tftp 82000000  $path/bl2_xxx.pbl;

        i2c mw 66 50 20;sf probe 0:1; sf erase 0 +$filesize; sf write 0x82000000 0x0 $filesize;

        tftp 82000000  $path/fip.bin;
        i2c mw 66 50 20;sf probe 0:1; sf erase 0x100000 +$filesize; sf write 0x82000000 0x100000 $filesize;

   --  Next step is valid for platform where FIP-DDR is needed.

   .. code:: shell

        tftp 82000000  $path/ddr_fip.bin;
        i2c mw 66 50 20;sf probe 0:1; sf erase 0x800000 +$filesize; sf write 0x82000000 0x800000 $filesize;

   --  Then reset to alternate bank to boot up ATF.

   Command for lx2160a, ls1088a and ls1028a platforms:

   .. code:: shell

        qixisreset altbank;

   Command for ls1046a platforms:

   .. code:: shell

        cpld reset altbank;

-  Deploy ATF images on SD/eMMC from U-Boot prompt.
   -- file_size_in_block_sizeof_512 = (Size_of_bytes_tftp / 512)

   .. code:: shell

        mmc dev <idx>; (idx = 1 for eMMC; idx = 0 for SD)

        tftp 82000000  $path/bl2_<sd>_or_<emmc>.pbl;
        mmc write 82000000 8 <file_size_in_block_sizeof_512>;

        tftp 82000000  $path/fip.bin;
        mmc write 82000000 0x800 <file_size_in_block_sizeof_512>;

    --  Next step is valid for platform that needs FIP-DDR.

   .. code:: shell

        tftp 82000000  $path/ddr_fip.bin;
        mmc write 82000000 0x4000 <file_size_in_block_sizeof_512>;

   --  Then reset to sd/emmc to boot up ATF from sd/emmc as boot-source.

   Command for lx2160A, ls1088a and ls1028a platforms:

   .. code:: shell

        qixisreset <sd or emmc>;

   Command for ls1043a and ls1046a platform:

   .. code:: shell

        cpld reset <sd or emmc>;

-  Deploy ATF images on IFC nor flash from U-Boot prompt.

   .. code:: shell

        tftp 82000000  $path/bl2_nor.pbl;
	protect off 64000000 +$filesize; erase 64000000 +$filesize; cp.b 82000000 64000000 $filesize;

        tftp 82000000  $path/fip.bin;
	protect off 64100000 +$filesize; erase 64100000 +$filesize; cp.b 82000000 64100000 $filesize;

   --  Then reset to alternate bank to boot up ATF.

   Command for ls1043a platform:

   .. code:: shell

        cpld reset altbank;

-  Deploy ATF images on IFC nand flash from U-Boot prompt.

   .. code:: shell

        tftp 82000000  $path/bl2_nand.pbl;
	nand erase 0x0 $filesize; nand write 82000000 0x0 $filesize;

        tftp 82000000  $path/fip.bin;
	nand erase 0x100000 $filesize;nand write 82000000 0x100000 $filesize;

   --  Then reset to nand flash to boot up ATF.
