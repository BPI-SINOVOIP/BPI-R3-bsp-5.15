Threat Model
============

Threat modeling is an important part of Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL)
that helps us identify potential threats and mitigations affecting a system.

In the next sections, we first give a description of the target of evaluation
using a data flow diagram. Then we provide a list of threats we have identified
based on the data flow diagram and potential threat mitigations.
