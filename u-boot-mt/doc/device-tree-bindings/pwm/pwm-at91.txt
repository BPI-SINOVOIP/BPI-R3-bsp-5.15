Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "atmel,sama5d2-pwm"
  - reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's registers.
  - clocks: Should contain a clock identifier for the PWM's parent clock.
  - #pwm-cells: Should be 3.

Example:

pwm0: pwm@f802c000 {
	compatible = "atmel,sama5d2-pwm";
	reg = <0xf802c000 0x4000>;
	clocks = <&pwm_clk>;
	#pwm-cells = <3>;
};
